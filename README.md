# Programming-Test
Programming Language:JAVA
Program-1
The program defines a Calculator class with methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
It takes user input for two numbers (a and b) and the type of operation (add, subtract, multiply, or divide).
The result is printed after performing the specified operation.

Program-2
Input: The user provides an integer a as input.
Logic:
We start with the number 1 and increment by 2 in each step to get the next odd number.
A loop runs a times to print the first a odd numbers.
Output: The program prints the first a odd numbers, separated by commas.

Program-3
Input: The user provides an integer a as input.
Logic:
We start with the number 1 and increment by 2 in each step to get the next odd number.
A loop runs a times to print the first a odd numbers.
Output: The program prints the first a odd numbers, separated by commas.

Program-4
Input: The array numbers holds the list of integers to be checked.
Logic:
We initialize a HashMap to store the count of multiples for each divisor (1 to 9).
For each number in the numbers array, we check if it is divisible by each of the divisors.
If a number is divisible by a divisor, we increment the count in the HashMap.
Output: The program prints the HashMap where keys are from 1 to 9, and values are the counts of multiples in the list.
